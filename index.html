              Software has released the Uplink Developer CD. This CD contains, 
              amoungst other things, the <b>complete source code</b> to Uplink 
              and all supporting tools and libraries. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
              Developer CD has been a heated topic of discussion at Introversion 
              for some time. We've had plenty of arguments about the pros and 
              cons of releasing the source to the public. There has always been 
              a plan to release the source code to Uplink at some point, but this 
              has never been possible due to commercial licensing problems - Introversion 
              could easily be put out of business if loads of free Uplink clones 
              started appearing on the market. We eventually came to the conclusion 
              that we'd have to wait until Uplink was no longer a &quot;commercial&quot; 
              product - but this means we'd be looking at sometime mid 2004 at 
              the earliest. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We've 
        decided to bring that date forward. We will have to impose a license on 
        the use of the source code - this won't be Open Source - and we will be 
        charging for that license. This means we will be keeping fairly close 
        control over this release. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We 
        will also introduce a new forum channel, but we'll keep it closed to the 
        public and only allow genuine Uplink developers inside. This will be the 
        perfect place for programmers to talk about the Uplink source code and 
        their mods, and to get help from the Developers themselves. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
        really is a fantastic opportunity for people to do whatever they want 
        with the Uplink source code. You could create new mission types, or add 
        in your very own plot. You could create new computer types. New easter 
        eggs. If you were feeling particularly ambitious you might try and create 
        a whole new type of system to attack - just like the LAN systems we introduced 
        in patch1.2 - complete with new graphics, new software tools, new challenges. 
        You could even try and add more networking functionality to the game - 
        but only if you're really brave ;) In short, there are a million things 
        a determined programmer could do with this source code.</font></p>
