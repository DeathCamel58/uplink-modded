                    At Introversion Software we believe that a game should not die simply
                    because it has reached the end of it's corporate development cycle.
                    That said, a open-source unlimited distribution of the game is not practical
                    for two reasons:<br>
                    1. It would be in breach of the licensing agreements that we have with
                    third party publishers<br>
                    2. Due to the &quot;hand-to-mouth&quot; nature of Independent Games
                    publishing a nominal fee for the source code of previous projects can
                    go a long way to ensure the funding of future development projects </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By
                    releasing the source code we hope that Uplink will be modified in a
                    variety of different ways:<br>
                    &middot; With additional functionality<br>
                    &middot; To Different Platforms<br>
                    &middot; To Different Languages</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We
                    envisage that Additional functionality will be achieved through the
                    medium of patches and we do not need to regulate this. That said, we
                    must insist that the user has a bone-fide version of Uplink installed
                    and as a consequence stand-alone binaries will be in breach of this
                    agreement. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Different
                    platforms and languages are slightly different. If we were to allow
                    a port to a different platform or language, this would potentially exclude
                    us from entering this market. In addition it may put us in violation
                    of any agreements between us and third party developers whom we had
                    paid to generate the new versions. That said if a port is produced for
                    a platform or language that we had not considered or were not currently
                    involved with, then we would be happy to consider licensing the version
                    from the developer for an agreed royalty.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
                    fundamentals are simple. If you change uplink and produce a &quot;patch&quot;
                    for a platform that we have sold on, then feel free to distribute it.
                    If you produce a totally new version, contact us and we'll try to work
                    something out.</font></p>

                    This License applies to the computer software known as &quot;Uplink&quot;,
                    developed and marketed by Introversion Software Ltd of Winchester House,
                    36 Winchester Road, Walton-On-Thames, Surry, KT12 2RH, UK (herein referred
                    to as &quot;Introversion&quot; or &quot;Us&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or
                    &quot;our&quot;). The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to the Uplink
                    executable, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either
                    the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,
                    a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
                    with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
                    translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
                    Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</font></p>

                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
                    the Program is not restricted.</font></p>

                    You may not copy or distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
                    code as you receive it. However, if you make serious modification to
                    the functionality of the program, then you may distribute only such
                    files as are necessary to share your modifications.</font></p>

                    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
                    that you also meet all of these conditions:</font></p>

                    You must cause the modified files to execute only if a copy of Uplink
                    purchased from Introversion Software (or one of it's licensed distributors),
                    is also installed on the machine. The modified version can require any
                    version of Uplink to be installed, however you must state this in a
                    read-me file attached with the distribution. You may only distribute
                    the files in object or executable form, you may not distribute the source
                    files unless in complete accordance with this license (Para 2).</font></p>

                    You must not release a &quot;stand-alone&quot; binary. By this we mean
                    a version of the Program that will execute without an enforced dependency
                    on installation of a version of Uplink purchased from Introversion or
                    one of its licensed distributors.</font></p>

                    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
                    as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
                    modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically

                    <br>
                    4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
                    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
                    the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
                    law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
                    the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
                    of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
                    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</font></p>

                    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
                    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
                    to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
                    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
                    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
                    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</font></p>

                    If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent infringement
                    or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are
                    imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
                    contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
                    the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
                    simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
                    obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
