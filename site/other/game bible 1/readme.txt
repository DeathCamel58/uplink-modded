CONGRATULATIONS!

You've successfully managed to break the code on book 1 of the designers bible. Well done.

There are three books in total.  Each one has all of the design work and notes that went into the game.  Pages and pages of program code, game logic, ideas, concept art, diaries and more.  The complete "behind the scenes" works.

You've just unlocked Book1.  This covers the first six months of Uplink's development - the ideas behind the game, the origional motivation and a few code design pages.  It starts on the 20th May 1999 - absolutely ages ago if you ask me.

I hope you enjoy reading this stuff.  I hope it gives you some insight.  If you want book2, you'll have to ask Introversion Software to give you the Uplink Bonus CD - check the web page for details.

As for book 3, who knows where that might be hidden.
