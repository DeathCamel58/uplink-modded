CONGRATULATIONS!

You've successfully managed to break the code on book 4 of the designers bible. Well done.

There are now four books in total - this one was never planned, and only came about after we did a stack load of work on the Nakatomi Patch.  Each Game Bible has all of the design work and notes that went into the game.  Pages and pages of program code, game logic, ideas, concept art, diaries and more.  The complete "behind the scenes" works.

You've just unlocked Book4.  This covers the continued development of Uplink, from Version 1.01 (released October 2001) until the present day (July 2002).  In this time we've completed work on the Nakatomi patch for Uplink (aimed squarely at the all Die Hard Uplink fans out there), we've started on Palm versions and Mac versions, and we've run a quality treasure hunt to celebrate on our site.  Which you know, of course, since you've just solved it.  Or did you cheat and get this file from a friend?  I hope you feel proud ;)

Mainly this GameBible covers the patch, and the LAN-based gameplay within.  It's been an incredibly long six months in development, something which we are quite ashamed of.  But hey, we got there in the end and we love the final product.  Uplink is definately a much better game now than it was before we started.

I hope you enjoy reading this stuff.  I hope it gives you some insight.  If you want books 1, 2 or 3, you'll have to ask around.  They are all hidden in various interesting places.

Finally, this file (JohnPhilips.dat) is designed to be downloadable from Kazaa and other File-Sharing programs.  Please continue to make this file available on your home systems via those File Sharing programs, so that other Treasure Hunters in the future can discover GameBible IV.  This can only work with your support.  Thanks.
