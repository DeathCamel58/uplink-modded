  Consequence Generator

	Responsible for analysing an action that has happened, and 
	generating subsequence "consequence" actions.

    This class should operate in DATA only - it shouldn't be handling
	screen flashes, interface changes etc.  Ideally it should stick to 
	the World module.

	Eg action   : A user is caught performing a hack
	consequence : His Uplink rating is decreased and he receives a fine
