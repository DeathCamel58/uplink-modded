            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This
                is a small but really rather clever perl script (written by John Knottenbelt
                - our Linux guru) to allow us to translate Uplink into any language we
                chose. It's still quite an involved process, since Uplink was never designed
                with this in mind. Using this script will make life a lot easier for you.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It's
                worth pointing you at paragraph 2.4 in the license agreement, which states</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>&quot;Without
                the express written permission of Introversion, you will not distribute
                in any format any non-English version of Uplink.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What
                this means is that if you translated the game into (say) French, you wouldn't
                be able to distribute it without our written permission. We want you to
                go ahead and translate into other languages though - so please go ahead
                - just keep in mind you can't distribute them yourself. If you do manage
                to finish a language translation that you think Introversion would be
                interested in (pretty much any language other than English/Russian/German)
                then get in contact with us and we'll work out a deal. If you've done
                the translation work then we'll be happy to cut you in on the profits.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
                basic process behind the script is this.</font></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">1. Put the translate.pl
                    script into the source directory</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2. Run the script
                    once to extract all the in-game strings to a file called strings.txt</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">3. Provide translations
                    of all the strings in that file that need translating (eg not debug
                    messages)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">4. Run the script
                    again to re-integrate the translated strings into the source code</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">5. Re-compile Uplink
                    with the translations in place.</font></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We've already provided
                a strings.txt file with every in-game string from version 1.31 of Uplink
                (the very latest). We recommend you start with this, as many strings are
                already marked as debug messages which don't need translating. Move the
                strings.txt file into your source directory next to translate.pl to use
                the existing strings. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In strings.txt you
                will see entries like this:</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>en*: "Finished saving
                %s\n" </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 'en*' at the
                front indicates it's in English, and the '*' indicates it _doesn't_ need
                translating because it's a debug message. You'll also see entries like
                this:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><b>en: &quot;Multiple
                Uplink Agent murders reported&quot;<br>
                gr: &quot;Mehrere Morde an Uplink Agenten gemeldet&quot;</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The first line starts
                with 'en' which indicates it's an English string that needs translation.
                The next line is a German translation of that line. We've left the German
                strings in the file as an example. You can actually have as many different
                translations in the strings.txt file as you wish, so long as each starts
                with a different 2 letter country code, such as 'en' or 'gr' or 'ru'.
                Each translation &quot;block&quot; consists of an English string, followed
                by any number of other-language translations, followed by a blank line.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Whenever you add
                new strings to the game, or change existing ones, you can re-extract the
                strings using the command</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>perl
                translate.pl --prune</b></font></i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This will go through
                all the source files recursively and will add in any new strings needed,
                and remove any unused ones. It will put all the strings into a new file
                called strings-pruned.txt. The original strings.txt is unmodified.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you want to generate
                an entirely new strings.txt file, you should first create an empty strings.txt
                file. Then run the command &quot;perl translate.pl --prune&quot;. This
                will put all the strings into the new file strings-pruned.txt. Keep in
                mind that you will have lost all of the 'en*' signs that signify a string
                doesn't need translating.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Once you've translated
                all the strings marked as 'en' (there are many thousands unfortunately)
                you can re-integrate them like this:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>perl
                translate.pl --lang=gr</b></font></i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This will take all
                the translations that start with 'gr' (insert your own country code here)
                and put them into the source files. The translated files will have the
                same filename, but with -trans on the end. For example uplink.cpp will
                be translated to uplink-trans.cpp. You can then build those trans files
                to get the new language.</font></p>
